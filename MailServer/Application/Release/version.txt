	// TODO: Rewrite Logging. Move to sql lite ? This gives faster searching possibilities.
        // TODO: Deprecrate XML API - Use sqllite instead.
	// TODO: Create "recycle bin" per user, store deleted messages for user hidden folder "__RecycleBin" 
                 Also create recylce bin setting per user, not global as now. This allows control per user

                 Allow to specify folders pattern what are stored to recycle bin, like "inbox;some folder".

                To try this feature just make account 'publicfolders' connect to this account with some IMAP client 
                what support ACL. Just make folders and apply acl to shared folders.
                Example:   
                        publicfolders/Documents
                        publicfolders/Archive

                Example:
                        (Your local account: myAccount)
                        Inbox
                        MyShared (ACL access specified)

                   This will be visible to public as:
                        Shared Folders/myAccount/MyShared  -> MyShared
        *) New: Partial IMAP SEARCH command (11.03.2005)
                Currently won't support keyword NOT,OR and parentized () search.
                If somebody has good idea how to implement parentized and nested seraches, please let me know.


        (NOTE: SQL users update stored procedures and you need to create new table!!! )
                Create table lsIMAP_ACL(        
                        Folder        nvarchar(500) Default (''),
                        [User]        nvarchar(100) Default (''),
                        [Permissions] nvarchar(20)  Default ('')

        *) Fix: POP3 TOP command didn't return more than 150 lines if requested so.
        *) New: Allow specify SMTP smart host username and password.
        *) Fix: SMTP relay didn't report host name specified in SMTP settings for Retry messages sending.

        *) New: Password hack dedector. Server allows 20 bad logins for IP+UserName in 5 minutes, after that it just skips
                password check and returns that login failed. Block will be released after 5 minutes.
        *) Fix: IMAP FETCH won't allow syntax body[header.fields (from)], requires (body[header.fields (from)]).
                This may happen only if  body[header.fields (from)] is only parameter for fetch.
        *) Fix: (For MSSQL API only) Domain deletion deleted all security entries.
        *) Fix: UserRule * pattern didn't worked when comapred header field was empty.
        *) Fix: If sender address is similar "sender@" (no domain specified) and destination sender was undeliverable, 
                server started endless undelivery warning loop.
        *) Fix: SMTP_Client (relay), some mailservers won't send '221 closing connection', just skip cheking this.
                This caused multiple messages duplication to destination recipient and reported local user that message was
                undeliverable.Duplication lasted while message undelivered time was reached.
        *) Fix: If dns server not available, don't consider message as undelivered, wait undelivery time. 
        *) New: DNSBL spam filtering. Just add this filter(ls_DNSBL_Filter.exe) in mailserver manager UI and configure running 
                ls_DNSBL_Filter.exe. NOTE: some default filters are already configured.
